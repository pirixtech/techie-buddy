# Privacy Policy

Techie Buddy operates as an Amazon Alexa Skill created by Pirix Technologies Inc. It is Techie’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating.

We use your Personal Information only to provide a personalized user experience. By enabling the skill, you agree to use of information in accordance with this policy.

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain users to Techie’s skill choose to interact with Techie in ways that require Techie to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Techie gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we use the provided access token to fetch information about the birthday of an user from Facebook. Techie collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the users's interaction with Techie. Techie does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And users can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information by not disabling the skill.

Information We Collect from Other Sources

With your authorization, we also obtain information about you from other sources. When you link your account to Facebook, we will receive information from that service (such as your birthday) via an API call to that service.

Data Retention Policy

We will not retain any user provided data.

Log Data

To be able to investigate issues with the skill, Techie stores logs with Amazon CloudWatch. These logs may included personally-identifying information as well, which are not exposed, sold or used besides the tracking of issues.

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Techie discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Techie’s behalf, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees may be located outside of your home country; by using Techie’s skill, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Techie will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, as described above, Techie discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Techie believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Techie, third parties or the public at large. Techie takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
