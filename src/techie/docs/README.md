According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, work-related musculoskeletal problems made up 32% of all worker injury and illness cases in 2014.

when your office job calls for you to sit at a desk for hours on end, “You tend to hunch forward, and your neck protrudes, and there’s eye strain. It’s stress that goes through your whole body.”

Desk job dangers:
- LOWER BACK PAIN

- EYE STRAIN
- TIGHT HIPS

#### Lower Back
How to Quickly Relieve Tension: To tame muscle tension when it crops up, rock your pelvis back and forth while seated in your desk chair, tilting your hips up and rounding your back, and then tilting your hips back. “That will help get those back muscles loosened up,” says Stephen Aguilar, occupational therapist and certified ergonomic assessment specialist at UCLA Rehabilitation Services.

#### Wrist Strain
Perform a prayer stretch, also known as a Buddha stretch: Place your fingers and palms together with your hands in front of your chest, fingers pointing upward. While keeping your palms together and your elbows moving out, lower your hands until you feel a good stretch in your wrists. Hold for five seconds.

#### Neck and Shoulder
It may be tempting to pop a couple of ibuprofen to dull the discomfort, but a 2012 study found that frequent neck and shoulder stretches on a daily basis were more effective at easing pain than over-the-counter and prescription anti-inflammatory drugs—or even seeing a chiropractor.

To release a tight neck, Fredericson recommends trying a chin tuck exercise, also known as neck retraction. While standing or sitting upright, keep your spine straight and push your head forward, jutting your chin out as far as possible. Slowly reverse the movement by pulling your head back as far as possible, as if recoiling away from someone. Your head should stay level throughout the stretch, which you’ll feel at the base of your neck. Repeat up to four times.

To relieve tension in your neck and shoulders simultaneously, face forward, tilt your right ear down toward your right shoulder, leaving your left arm hanging straight down to increase the stretch. Hold for 20 to 60 seconds and repeat on the left side up to four times.

#### Eye
Every 20 to 30 minutes, look at something off in the distance, such as a window across the length of the office, for 20 seconds to give your eyes a break. Better yet, get up and chat with a coworker in another area of the office or run to the supply closet to grab a new pen—anything to give your eyes a break from the computer.

#### Hips
Try doing a stretch to release tight hip flexors. Kneel on your left knee—like you are about to propose to someone—and place your right foot forward with your right knee bent at a 90-degree angle. Shift your pelvis forward, bend your front knee and tuck your butt under until you feel a deeper stretch in the left hip. Hold for 30 seconds. Switch legs.
